This repository contains the code for the Assignment 2 of the 2024/25 Algorithms and Parallel Computing course @ PoliMi. The aim of the exercise is to implement the different classes which make up the hidden layers of **LeNet-5**, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) first proposed by Yann Lecun et al. in the 1998 paper *"Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition"*, which has become a classic in modern Deep Learning (DL) literature. More informations are available in the "Assignment2\_2024.pdf" file.

In the future my aim is to turn this into a more complex personal project, rewriting the code and implementing training of the model from scratch, in order to achieve same results as in the authors' original work. My hope is to do this by also applying hardware acceleration on the GPU, using MPI or maybe writing directly in CUDA/msl (based on the architecture).
